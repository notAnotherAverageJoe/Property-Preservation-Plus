# Project Proposal

1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? ->>

   I will be using Node, React, Exptress, and PostgresQL

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
   you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application? ->>

   This will be a evenly focused project, I want the UI to be clear, clear and consicse in order to help users have a smooth experience. In order to do this I will leverage some heavy lifting backend.

3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else? ->>

   It will be a web based platform for property management.

4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve? ->>

   To simplify the paper trail required for good management of proprties.
   The main goal is to allow one spot, one platform that offers deep insight into
   the health and well being of a property, its maintence requirements and the
   revenue after that maintence. This would allow companies to focus on what needs to be done and not let small needs slip through the cracks until they become large repairs. For example if the property managers keep overlooking empty apartments that had the A/C turned off especialliy in hot humid weather like florida, mold will grow and become a serious problem. This would be a piece of information my system will ensure does not go unnoticed.

5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
   your users? ->>

   This is a business based and focused application, I want companies like bozzuto and livcor to use this system. The aim is to simplifiy vital information for each property allowing more structure for proper maintenance and focusing on prevention and preservation.

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
   Maintenance Planning: ->>
   I will use a weather api:
   have yet to narrow down to one, but likely will be OpenweatherMap or weatherApi since I have worked with both.

   ## WeatherAPI

   ## OpenWeatherMap API

   ## AccuWeather API

   ## Climacell (Tomorrow.io) API

   ## Weatherbit API

   Weather data can help property managers schedule maintenance tasks. For example, outdoor repairs like roofing or landscaping should be planned around favorable weather conditions. It can also
   alert tenants and maintenance staff in advance about potential disruptions due to severe weather.

7. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?

   Working with latitude and longitude could be a potential issue, since this is not something people often work with. Also the limitations the API's place on how are out one can look with a free version of it maybe lead to some shortcomings. I will research each of the options to see which offers the most vital weather information.

8. What functionality will your app include?

   It will accept properties, units, tenants, and have maintenance requests and fullfillment. This information will be used to showcase the overall profitability of a property help manage rent space and keep maintenance focused on preventative care.

9. What will the user flow look like?

10. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch
    goals?
    The information given goes beyond a simple create a cupcake or img and edit then delete, this system will monitor property health based on income and expenses.
    Would like to get to a emergency txt or email system to tenants that warns of bad weather.
